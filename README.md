## Project Overview and Description:
 - For the midterm project, me and my teammate have decided to choose Acmeâ€™s perception robotic module & work on the deliverables and provide a high-quality solution following the essential software engineering practices which they can directly integrate into their product.
 - Computer vision based automatic human detector and tracker ywhich gives location coordinates of multiple humans detected in a realtime video feed from a monocular video camera.
 
## Purpose of the Project
 - The purpose this project is to detect a human from the live feed from the camera and generate the co-ordinates of the location in the robot fixed frame. It shall also track the multiple human obstacles from the image.

## How to build, run & test (from command line)
 - Run the following commands in order
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/stark-2000/Midterm-Project_Group-8.git
cd Midterm-Project_Group-8
python3 openCV.py
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./test/cpp-test
./app/my_app
```
## Command to check Google Style and run static code analysis
- From the app directory run the following command
```
cpplint $( find . -name main.cpp) > cpplintlog
cppcheck --enable=all --std=c++11 --suppress=missingIncludeSystem $( find . -name main.cpp) > cppchecklog
```
## Instructions for code coverage
- From the build directory run the following command
```
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
make code_coverage
```
## How to generate Doxygen documentation (from command line)
- From the app directory run the following command
```
doxygen main.cpp
cd html
firefox index.html
```
