## Project Overview and Description:
 - For the midterm project, me and my teammate have decided to choose Acme’s perception robotic module & work on the deliverables and provide a high-quality solution following the essential software engineering practices which they can directly integrate into their product.
 - Computer vision based automatic human detector and tracker ywhich gives location coordinates of multiple humans detected in a realtime video feed from a monocular video camera.
 
## Purpose of the Project
 - The purpose this project is to detect a human from the live feed from the camera and generate the co-ordinates of the location in the robot fixed frame. It shall also track the multiple human obstacles from the image.
